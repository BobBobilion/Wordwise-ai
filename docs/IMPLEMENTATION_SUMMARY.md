## Rich Text Editor Implementation (2024-06-20)

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive TipTap-based rich text editor with AI-powered grammar checking and highlighting capabilities.

### Key Actions Taken

#### 1. **Dependency Installation**
- Installed TipTap core packages: `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`
- Installed TipTap extensions: `@tiptap/extension-text-align`, `@tiptap/extension-font-family`, `@tiptap/extension-text-style`, `@tiptap/extension-underline`, `@tiptap/extension-history`
- Attempted to install `@tiptap/extension-font-size` but encountered version compatibility issues

#### 2. **Core Component Development**
- Created `components/rich-text-editor.tsx` with comprehensive TipTap implementation
- Implemented custom FontSize extension due to unavailability of official extension for TipTap v2
- Built custom HighlightExtension for AI-powered spelling/grammar error highlighting
- Added keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+U (redo)
- Implemented cursor position preservation during system edits

#### 3. **Type System Enhancement**
- Added `GrammarSuggestion` interface to `lib/types.ts`
- Added `HighlightMark` interface for highlighting system
- Ensured type safety throughout the implementation

#### 4. **Editor Integration**
- Updated `app/editor/[id]/page.tsx` to integrate with new rich text editor
- Added AI grammar checking functionality with real-time analysis
- Implemented suggestion management (apply/dismiss)
- Added loading states and error handling
- Integrated highlighting system with click-to-view functionality

#### 5. **Sidebar Component Updates**
- Updated `components/sidebar/writing-sidebar.tsx` to handle optional suggestions
- Added suggestion count badges
- Provided default handlers for better integration

#### 6. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated `PRD.txt` to reflect completed Phase 9: Advanced Rich Text Editor
- Documented all implemented features and capabilities

### Features Implemented

#### **Text Formatting**
- Bold, italic, underline
- Text alignment (left, center, right, justify)
- Font families (Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New)
- Font sizes (12px to 32px)

#### **AI Integration**
- Real-time grammar checking via API
- Visual highlighting of errors (red for grammar, yellow for style)
- Clickable highlights with suggestion details
- Apply/dismiss suggestion functionality

#### **User Experience**
- Custom undo/redo with Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+U
- Copy/paste functionality
- Cursor position preservation
- Bubble menu for quick formatting
- Loading indicators and toast notifications

### Technical Achievements
- **Type-safe implementation** with full TypeScript support
- **Performance optimized** with debounced content checking
- **Seamless integration** with existing codebase
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- **Responsive design** with glassmorphism effects

### Files Modified/Created

## Lessons Learned

1. **Version Compatibility:** TipTap v2 and v3 have significant differences in extension availability
2. **Custom Extensions:** Sometimes necessary to create custom extensions when official ones aren't available
3. **Type Safety:** Proper TypeScript interfaces are crucial for maintainable code
4. **Integration Strategy:** Gradual integration with existing systems prevents breaking changes
5. **Performance:** Debouncing is essential for real-time AI integration
