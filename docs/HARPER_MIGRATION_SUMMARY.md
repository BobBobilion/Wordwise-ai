# Harper.js Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete migration from LLM-based grammar and spelling checking to Harper.js, a lightweight, privacy-focused grammar and spelling linter that runs server-side.

## Migration Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Integration ✅ COMPLETE

**What We Accomplished:**
- Successfully installed Harper.js (`npm install harper.js`)
- Created unified `/api/harper-check/route.ts` endpoint to replace separate spelling/grammar APIs
- Configured Next.js for WebAssembly support in `next.config.mjs`
- Implemented dynamic import to avoid SSR issues: `const { LocalLinter, binaryInlined } = await import('harper.js')`

**Issues Faced:**
- **WASM Path Resolution**: Encountered double path errors (`C:\C:\`) due to Windows path handling
- **SSR Compatibility**: Harper.js couldn't be imported at module level due to WebAssembly requirements
- **Next.js Configuration**: Required specific WebAssembly configuration for proper WASM loading

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Used dynamic imports to load Harper.js only on the server side
- Fixed WASM path resolution by using `binaryInlined` instead of file paths
- Added proper Next.js WebAssembly configuration

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration ✅ COMPLETE

**What We Accomplished:**
- Updated `components/rich-text-editor.tsx` to use unified Harper.js API
- Modified `components/sidebar/writing-suggestions.tsx` to handle spelling, grammar, and style types
- Updated highlight system with proper color coding (spelling=red, grammar=yellow, style=purple)
- Integrated with existing suggestion application system

**Issues Faced:**
- **API Response Format**: Had to map Harper.js response to existing `GrammarSuggestion` interface
- **Type Compatibility**: Needed to handle both spelling and grammar suggestions in unified format
- **Real-time Integration**: Required debounced checking to maintain performance

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Created response mapping function to convert Harper.js Lint objects to existing interface
- Updated frontend components to handle unified suggestion types
- Maintained existing debouncing logic for real-time checking

### Phase 3: WASM Object Handling 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Major Challenge Discovered:**
The Harper.js library returns WASM-backed objects that are not plain JavaScript objects. Each Lint object only exposes a `__wbg_ptr` property when inspected, but the actual data must be accessed by calling methods on the objects.

**Issues Faced:**
1. **WASM Object Access**: Initially tried to access properties directly, but they were undefined
2. **Method Calling**: Discovered that `span()`, `suggestions()`, `message()`, and `kind()` are methods, not properties
3. **Suggestion Extraction**: Harper.js returns Suggestion objects that also need method calls to extract text
4. **React Rendering**: WASM objects with `__wbg_ptr` cannot be rendered as React children

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Working**: Harper.js successfully detects spelling and grammar issues
- ✅ **Working**: Text spans are correctly extracted (start/end positions)
- ✅ **Working**: Problem descriptions are properly extracted
- ❌ **Issue**: Suggestions are still WASM objects and not being converted to strings properly

**Latest Test Results:**
```
Text found: "Helo"
Suggestion: "Helo" (identical to the error - fallback logic)
Text found: "tezt" 
Suggestion: "tezt" (identical to the error - fallback logic)
```

**Root Cause Identified:**
The suggestion extraction logic is falling back to using the original misspelled text because:
1. Harper.js returns Suggestion objects that need method calls to extract text
2. The current extraction logic is not properly calling the methods on Suggestion objects
3. When suggestions array is empty, the fallback `suggestionsArr[0] || text` uses the original text

## Technical Implementation Details

### Harper.js API Understanding
```javascript
// Harper.js returns an array of Lint objects
const result = await linter.lint(text);

// Each Lint object has methods (not properties):
lint.span()     // Returns { start: number, end: number }
lint.suggestions() // Returns array of Suggestion objects
lint.message()  // Returns string description
lint.kind()     // Returns "grammar" | "spelling"
```

### Current Response Mapping
```typescript
// Current mapping function (needs improvement)
function mapHarperResponse(harperLints: any[], originalText: string): GrammarSuggestion[] {
  return harperLints.map((lint) => {
    const span = lint.span(); // ✅ Working
    const description = lint.message(); // ✅ Working
    const suggestions = lint.suggestions(); // ❌ Needs improvement
    // ... mapping logic
  });
}
```

### Performance Achievements
- **Processing Time**: 2-20ms (target: <20ms) ✅ ACHIEVED
- **API Consolidation**: Single endpoint vs separate spelling/grammar endpoints ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Privacy**: 100% server-side processing ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Cost Savings**: Eliminated AI API costs for grammar/spelling ✅ ACHIEVED

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Harper.js Integration**: Successfully initialized and running
2. **Text Detection**: Correctly identifies spelling and grammar issues
3. **Position Mapping**: Accurately extracts start/end positions for highlighting
4. **Problem Descriptions**: Properly extracts human-readable descriptions
5. **Frontend Integration**: UI components updated and functional
6. **Performance**: <20ms processing time achieved
7. **Privacy**: No external API calls for grammar/spelling

### ❌ Current Issue
**Suggestion Extraction**: The suggestions are still WASM objects and not being converted to proper strings. The fallback logic is using the original misspelled text as the suggestion.

### 🔄 Next Steps Required
1. **Fix Suggestion Extraction**: Properly call methods on Suggestion objects to extract actual suggestion text
2. **Test with Real Suggestions**: Verify that actual spelling corrections are being provided
3. **Validate Accuracy**: Ensure Harper.js suggestions are accurate and useful

## Migration Benefits Achieved

### Performance Benefits ✅
- **Speed**: Reduced from 500ms-2s (AI) to <20ms (Harper.js)

- **Specialized accuracy** for English grammar/spelling
- **Immediate feedback** with real-time checking

## Lessons Learned

### WASM Integration Challenges
1. **Object Access Patterns**: WASM objects require method calls, not property access
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces need to account for WASM object behavior
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling needed for WASM function calls
4. **React Compatibility**: WASM objects cannot be directly rendered in React

### Harper.js Specific Insights
1. **API Design**: Harper.js uses a method-based API rather than property-based
2. **Suggestion Objects**: Suggestions are complex objects requiring method calls
3. **Performance**: Extremely fast processing once properly configured
4. **Accuracy**: Good detection of spelling and grammar issues

### Migration Strategy Success
1. **Phased Approach**: Breaking migration into phases allowed for incremental progress
2. **Testing Strategy**: Regular testing with real text inputs revealed issues early
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive logging helped identify and debug issues
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when components fail

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Phase 2: Diff-Based Linting
- Implement intelligent caching and diff-based processing
- Only re-lint changed regions for optimal performance
- Add sentence-level caching for repeated content

### Phase 3: Advanced Caching
- Implement document-level caching strategies
- Add intelligent cache invalidation
- Optimize memory usage for large documents

### Phase 4: Style Check Separation
- Create separate AI-based style checking endpoint
- Combine Harper.js grammar/spelling with AI style suggestions
- Enhanced UI for different suggestion types

## Conclusion

The Harper.js migration has been largely successful, achieving the primary goals of:
- ✅ Eliminating AI API costs for grammar/spelling
- ✅ Improving performance (20ms vs 500ms-2s)
- ✅ Enhancing privacy with server-side processing
- ✅ Maintaining functionality with unified API

The remaining issue with suggestion extraction is a technical implementation detail that can be resolved by properly calling the methods on Harper.js Suggestion objects. Once this is fixed, the migration will be complete and fully functional.
